Compiling
---------

Just typing 'make' should work, if g++ or clang++ are installed.
Other compilers that support C++14 should also work, but they might
require you to adjust the Makefile.

After building the two executables 'simulator' and
'symbolic_scheduler' should be created.

Use
---

To run one of the programs you need an input file that describes the
taskset.  The format was not designed for easy writing but for easy
parsing, but it should still be easy enough.  The first line should
only contain the number of tasks, followed by one line per task. Each
of these lines should contain name, period, deadine, pwcet
distribution, and deadlines for the criticality levels.  The number of
criticality levels gives the criticality of the task -- a LO task only
has one deadline, a HI task has two.  The number of criticality levels
(and thus deadlines) is not limited.  There is an example in
tasks-example.

To run symbolic_scheduler with this input type
$ ./symbolic_scheduler <tasks-example
